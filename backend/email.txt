Subject: Tickets for tonight
Time: 9:27 AM

Hey!

Just wanted to make sure you have the tickets handy, so Iâ€™m attaching them here. If we end up arriving at different times, at least youâ€™ll have your own copy. ðŸ˜Š

Doors open at 6:30 PM, and the show starts at 7:00 sharp, so letâ€™s try to be there a bit early if possible. Iâ€™ll bring snacks for the drive!

Also â€” donâ€™t forget to wear something comfy, they mentioned it might get chilly inside the venue.

Canâ€™t wait for tonight! Itâ€™s going to be so fun.

â€“ Darla
