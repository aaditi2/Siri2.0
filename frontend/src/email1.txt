Dear Aditi,
This is to inform you that your business proposal for a bakery startup has unfortunately been rejected by our committee. While we did like your idea, unfortunately, the costs involved reach well beyond our budget for this quarter. 
We wish you the best of luck in your future endeavours and encourage you to submit additional proposals if you have others that are aligned with our goals.
Best of luck,
Y Combinator team
